book-text-sloth-clown-pz-starcup = Chuckles was performing at a new space station, and he was excited to bring his brand of joy and laughter to a new audience. But this time, he wasn't alone. He had brought his trusty sloth friend, Snuggles, along for the adventure.
      As soon as they arrived, Chuckles and Snuggles went exploring the space station. They came across a group of Diona children, who were sad and upset. Chuckles asked them what was wrong, and they told him that they had lost their favorite toy, a small stuffed animal named Twinkle.
      Chuckles knew that he had to help. He and Snuggles searched the space station, looking high and low for Twinkle. They even asked the other species for help. The unathi were too busy sunbathing, the Humans were too busy working, but the Slimes were happy to help.
      Together, they searched the space station until they finally found Twinkle. The Diona children were overjoyed, and they thanked Chuckles and Snuggles for their help.
      As a thank-you gift, the Diona children asked Chuckles to perform a special show just for them. Chuckles and Snuggles worked together to create a show that was full of fun and laughter, with plenty of juggling, balloon animals, and silly tricks.
      The Diona children loved the show and were laughing and clapping the whole time. And when it was over, they gave Chuckles and Snuggles a big hug, thanking them for making them happy again.
      Chuckles and Snuggles left the space station feeling happy and fulfilled. They knew that their adventures would continue, and that they would continue to bring joy and laughter to all the species they met.
      As Chuckles looked back on his adventures, he realized that he couldn't have done it without his friends. Whether it was Snuggles the sloth, the Zorgs who played pranks on him, or the Diona children who needed his help, Chuckles knew that the power of laughter could bring species together, no matter how different they may be.

book-text-sloth-clown-mmd-starcup = Chuckles was traveling through space with his friend Snuggles the sloth, looking for their next adventure. They came across a planet inhabited by unathi, who were known for their love of games and challenges. Chuckles and Snuggles decided to explore the planet and see what kind of games they could find.
      As they walked through the unathi's city, they saw a crowd of unathi gathered around a large game board. Chuckles and Snuggles went over to investigate, and they saw that the unathi were playing a game called "The Maze of Mystery."
      The rules of the game were simple: the player had to navigate through a maze of obstacles and traps, with the goal of reaching the end before their opponent. The catch was that the maze changed every time it was played, so the player had to be quick on their feet and think on their toes.
      Chuckles and Snuggles were intrigued and decided to join in on the fun. They were paired up with a pair of unathi siblings, named Lizzy and Lenny. Lizzy was a bit of a know-it-all, while Lenny was more laid-back and easy-going.
      The game was intense, with the maze changing every few seconds. Chuckles and Snuggles had a hard time keeping up, but they soon realized that the key to winning was to work together. Chuckles used his juggling skills to distract the opponents, while Snuggles used his slow and steady pace to carefully navigate through the maze.
      As they reached the end of the maze, they were met with a surprise. The maze had led them to a hidden room, where a group of Slimes were waiting for them. The Slimes explained that they had been watching the game and were impressed by Chuckles and Snuggles's teamwork.
      As a reward, the Slimes took them on a tour of their secret slime garden. The garden was full of colorful and exotic plants, and the Slimes explained that they used the plants to create special potions and medicines. Chuckles and Snuggles were fascinated, and they asked if they could take some of the plants with them as a souvenir.
      The Slimes agreed, and Chuckles and Snuggles left the planet feeling happy and fulfilled. They knew that they had made new friends and learned a valuable lesson about working together. They also had a new souvenir to add to their collection, which they would treasure for years to come.

book-text-sparot-book =    [head=1]What is the Sparot?[/head]

    The classic Sparot deck is a beautiful patchwork quilt, a complex collection of 1069 different tiles (or sometimes gamepieces) with elements gathered from different games from across the galactic community.

    But all those pieces are a huge hassle to transport through space, so it is usually encountered on stations as a collection of 54 playing cards.

    Disregard, for a moment, all talk of prophecy, all promises of seeker-clowns and self-styled seers. What this ancient art truly offers is a way to look inward. If the cards should happen to tell you your fortune, it's because you already knew, deep down, where you were going to go.


    {"[head=1]Arranging a Reading[/head]"}
    The Sparot is divided into four suits of thirteen cards each, plus two special cards collectively called the Fantasia.

    The four suits are Cables, Discs, Knives, and Sparrows (a class of flying Terran animals widely repopulated across the harpy planet of Peaseblossom). Each suit stands for a set of ideas, elements, and themes. The numbered cards (1-10) of each suit represent a kind of journey through the story the suit tells, while the three face cards (Knight/Maid, Princess, and Queen) represent especially important persons or critical lessons related to it.

    There are many methods of conducting a reading, and truthfully, the method you use matters not half as much as your confidence in using it. This book will therefore present a simple method usable with the cheapest decks.

    As the dealer, while shuffling, have the subject consider a question they would like to ask. They may ask it out loud or keep it to themselves.

    Next, deal out five cards from the deck and place them in the below configuration facing the subject. Give each card a thorough spin so you don’t know whether it is upside-down or right-side up from the target’s point of view. An upside-down card is considered Reversed, creating a twist or inversion to its meaning.

    {"[mono]    [1][/mono]"}
    {"[mono][2] [3] [4][/mono]"}
    {"[mono]    [5][/mono]"}

    Each of these five positions is important and will help you interpret the card within it.

    {"[bold]1: The Problem[/bold]. This card represents something about the subject’s question."}
    {"[bold]2: The Past[/bold]. This card represents something from the subject’s history that impacts the question."}
    {"[bold]3: The Present[/bold]. This card tells us about the subject’s current situation."}
    {"[bold]4: The Future[/bold]. This card tells us where the subject’s question might lead."}
    {"[bold]5: The Warning[/bold], or [bold]The Promise[/bold]. This card tells us about a potential barrier or danger, a price to be paid, or an opportunity that must not be ignored."}


    {"[head=1]The Cards' Meanings[/head]"}
    You are free to diverge from the meanings presented here, but remember that you dabble with dangerous forces. Beware of trying to force the cards to say what you want them to say, rather than what you truly believe they are telling you.

    The cards' reversed meanings are italicized.

    {"[head=2]The Fantasia[/head]"}
    There are only two cards in this version of the Sparot's Fantasia: The Devil and the Clown. The Fantasia are considered especially impactful when they appear in a reading.

    In cheap decks where the two Fantasia cards are identical, the first Fantasia card played is always the Devil, meaning the Clown only appears when the Devil is already in play. If a Clown is in the room when the reading is conducted, this rule is reversed.

    {"[bold]The Devil[/bold]"}
    Also called the Mime, the Devil represents possibility, but also temptation. The Devil on the card is silent as she waits for a choice to be made, for she knows the choice [italic]must[/italic] be made... and knows desire usually wins out. The temptation might be part of a cycle that may or may not be breakable. [italic]When reversed, the Devil represents a false choice, or a false dichotomy.[/italic]

    {"[bold]The Clown[/bold]"}
    The Clown represents calamity, a drastic change that the target must brace for. The Clown on the card is joyous as she dances above the blaze. [italic]When reversed, the target will be the source of the catastrophe for others, or the catastrophe will be something necessary to clear the way for new growth.[/italic]

    {"[head=2]The Suits[/head]"}
    {"[bold]Cables:[/bold]"} As cables and wires tie together a system, the Suit of Cables stands for bodily health and relationships, things which require connections and cooperation to survive. This suit also stands for conductive metals, electricity, rubber, and plant life. Sometimes called the Suit of Clubs.

    {"[bold]Discs:[/bold]"} As an embodiment of the storage of precious data, the Suit of Discs stands for wealth, resources, knowledge, and containment, as well as the elements of plastic, light, and insulative metals. The Suit of Discs is also sometimes tied to histories and stories.

    {"[bold]Knives:[/bold]"} The Suit of Knives stands for conflicts and disruption, as well as earth and food chemistry. Although often viewed as an evil or ominous suit, Knives plays just as important a role in romance as betrayal. Sometimes called the Suit of Spades.

    {"[bold]Sparrows:[/bold]"} The Suit of Sparrows stands for emotions, intuition, and exploration, as well as water, air, animals, and space. Originally called the Suit of Dragons.

     • [bold]10 of Sparrows:[/bold] The journey reaches an end. A transformation is complete. A new home. Emotional tumult finally settles. [italic]A false catharsis. The journey leads its walker back where they started, but all has been transformed, including them. There will always be another path. Whether one embarks on a new adventure is up to them.[/italic]
     • [bold]Knight of Sparrows:[/bold] The Knight of Sparrows is a daring explorer or an intuitive thinker who solves problems with emotional intellAigence.
