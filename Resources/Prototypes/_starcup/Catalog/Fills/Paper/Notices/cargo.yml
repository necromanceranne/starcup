      capsules in a circumstance that may pose a danger to
      the safety and well-being of employees, corporate
      assets, and civilians under the protection of the
      appropriate legal institutions. [bold]The doorway of the
      shelter may be used to for protection from hazardous
      weather conditions.[/bold]

      The issue has been remedied on the assembly
      line and shall not affect future shipments of capsules.
      Your station will receive corrected units at a future
      date according to traditional supply and procurement
      operating procedure. We thank you for your attention
      on this matter.
